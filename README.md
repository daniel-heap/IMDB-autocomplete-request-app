# IMDB-autocomplete-request-app
 A simple android app that uses the IMDB API to make an autocomplete request.

I found the endpoint and the dococumentation for the API on RapidAPI [here](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/).

The API key is not included, you can get your own by creating a RapidAPI account (this is what I did anyway).
